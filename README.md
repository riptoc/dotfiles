# Riptoc's Linux Dotfiles

A selection of dotfiles for my linux systems.
Set up as a bare repo on the system to track these files.

## Included in this repo
+ Awesome WM setup + theme
+ Vim settings
+ Vscode settings
+ Zsh settings
+ Git settings
+ Various scripts
+ Terminal emulator settings

There is a script (bin/getdotfiles) that will install these dotfiles, however
it will overwrite any existing ones. Also bin/installsoftware will install 
required software.

Feel free to make suggestions for improvement ðŸ™‚
