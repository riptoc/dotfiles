# Riptoc's Linux Dotfiles

A selection of dotfiles for my arch linux systems.
Set up as a bare repo on the system to track these files.

## Included in this repo
+ Awesome WM setup + theme
+ Vim settings
+ Zsh settings
+ Git settings
+ Terminal emulator settings
+ Various scripts located in `bin`

There is a script `bin/getdotfiles` that will install these dotfiles, however
it will overwrite any existing ones and is intended for a clean install of
arch linux.

The script at `bin/installsoftware` will install frequently used or required
software.

Feel free to make suggestions for improvement ðŸ™‚
