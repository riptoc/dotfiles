# Riptoc's Linux Dotfiles

A selection of dotfiles for my linux systems.

Set up as a bare repo on the system to track these files.

**These are a work in progress, do not expect perfection**

## Included in this repo

+ i3-gaps setup
+ nvim
+ zsh
+ Quick Xmodmap script to make Caps Lock another Esc key

Feel free to make suggestions for improvement.
