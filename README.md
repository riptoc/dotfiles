# Riptoc's Linux Dotfiles

A selection of dotfiles for my linux systems.

Set up as a bare repo on the system to track these files.

**These are a work in progress, do not expect perfection**

## Included in this repo
+ Awesome WM setup
+ nvim settings
+ vscode settings (don't use this much anymore)
+ zsh settings
+ emacs (spacemacs) settings
+ some git settings
+ setup scripts
+ urxvt settings

Feel free to make suggestions for improvement ðŸ™‚
